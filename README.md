MNPW-Services
=============
This is a project to create an ionic app to send push notification to a user based on their Nashville address of the next trash, recycling, and brush collection times.  It is a set-it-and-forget-it app.  Set the address and the app will remind the user the day before a trash or recycling pickup and up to one week prior to a brush collection pickup.


**To install:** in your terminal in your code directory, type the following:
---------------------------------------------

  git clone *https://github.com/ldmcdaniel/MNPW-Services*

  cd MNPW-Services

  bower install

Open with your favorite text editor and you should be ready to start coding.
